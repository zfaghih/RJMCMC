Trans-D CSEM Bayesian inversion recently implemented to create results presented in Faghih et al. 2023 "Characterizing Offshore Freshened Groundwater Salinity Patterns using Transdimensional Bayesian Inversion of Controlled Source Electromangetic Data: A Case Study from the Canterbury Bight, New Zealand"

The code is based on Jan Dettmer, Stan Dosso, and Charles Holland's work "Trans-dimensional geoacoustic inversion" published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America (2010)

The CSEM implementation is presented in "Trans‐dimensional Bayesian inversion of controlled‐source electromagnetic data in the German North Sea" by Romina Gehrmann et al. in Geophysical Prospecting (2015)

The CSEM forward code "MARTIN" was coded by Carsten Scholl.
